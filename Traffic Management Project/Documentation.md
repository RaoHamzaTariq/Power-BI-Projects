# Traffic Management Dashboard

## Project Overview:
The Traffic Management Dashboard provides comprehensive insights into traffic accidents, offering analysis on total accidents, casualties, contributing factors, accident trends over time, and patterns related to vehicles, streets, and accident occurrences.

## Insights:
- Total accidents: 238,420
- Injured: 116,000
- Fatalities: 632
- Top contributing factors:
  - Driver Inattention/Distraction: 58,308 accidents
  - Unspecified: 58,262 accidents
- Passenger vehicles account for 84.66% of accidents.
- Most accidents occur at 12 am, with around 4,000 incidents.
- Prominent streets: Belt Parkway (3,728 accidents) and Broadway (2,794 accidents).
- March has the highest accidents, totaling 25,009.
- The first 5 days of each month are particularly prone to accidents.

## Recommendations:
1. **Seasonal Awareness**: Implement targeted awareness campaigns during months with higher accident rates.
2. **Time-specific Initiatives**: Launch initiatives focused on specific days and times when accidents are most prevalent, particularly during late-night hours.
3. **Street Safety Measures**: Introduce enhanced safety measures on high-accident streets to reduce collisions.
4. **Inattention Prevention**: Develop programs to combat driver inattention/distraction.
5. **Fatal Accident Interventions**: Target interventions towards contributing factors for fatal accidents.
6. **Vehicle Type-specific Initiatives**: Tailor safety initiatives to address challenges posed by different vehicle types.
7. **Time-of-Month Vigilance**: Heighten vigilance and enforcement during the first 5 days of each month.
