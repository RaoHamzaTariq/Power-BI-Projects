# Apple Environmental Emission Dashboard

## Project Overview 
The Apple Environmental Emission Dashboard provides insights into Apple's environmental impact, focusing on metrics such as total carbon emissions, carbon removal, emission reduction opportunities, emission breakdown by category, market capitalization, environmental initiatives, emissions by scope and fiscal year, product footprint, employee engagement, top emissions sectors, and more.


## Insights (Observations):
1. **Emission Trends:**
   - Emissions peaked in fiscal year 2017 at 27.4 million metric tons of CO2e.
   - In fiscal year 2022, emissions hit their lowest point since 2015, totaling 20.2 million metric tons of CO2e.
   - Projections for early 2030 suggest a significant drop in emissions to 3.4 million metric tons.
3. **Carbon Footprint by Product:**
   - iPhone X has the highest Carbon Footprint of 79 kg CO2e.
   - iPhone 6s recorded the highest Emissions of 38.4 million metric tons CO2e.
4. **Total Carbon Removals vs. Total Emissions:**
   - Carbon removals accounted for 1.06 million metric tons, reducing total emissions from 66 million to 65.32 million metric tons.
5. **Opportunity for Emission Reduction:**
   - "Manufacturing (purchased goods and services)" recorded the highest emissions, totaling 15.66 million metric tons of CO2e (74.26%).
6. **Apple's Employees and Environmental Initiatives:**
   - Apple's ability to maintain or increase its workforce while reducing emissions is a positive sign.
7. **Apple's Market Capitalization and Environmental Initiatives:**
   - A moderate negative correlation coefficient (0.4832) suggests a relationship between Apple's market capitalization and environmental initiatives.

## Actions and Recommendations:
- **Continued Emission Reduction:**
  - Accelerate efforts to reduce emissions across all scopes, aiming for 75% reduction compared to the 2015 baseline by 2027.
- **Renewable Energy:**
  - Invest in renewable energy sources for corporate operations and manufacturing facilities.
- **Supply Chain Optimization:**
  - Collaborate with suppliers to reduce emissions and promote sustainable practices.
- **Product Design:**
  - Integrate sustainability into product design and manufacturing processes.
- **Carbon Offsets:**
  - Continue investing in carbon offset projects and support high-impact carbon removal initiatives.
- **Employee Engagement:**
  - Engage employees in sustainability initiatives and promote sustainable commuting options.
- **Consumer Education:**
  - Educate consumers about product environmental impact and promote responsible use.
- **Innovation:**
  - Invest in research and development for innovative technologies and processes.
- **Transparency and Reporting:**
  - Maintain transparency in reporting emissions and progress towards carbon neutrality.
- **Collaboration:**
  - Collaborate with other companies, organizations, and governments to address climate change collectively.
- **Continuous Monitoring:**
  - Implement a robust monitoring and reporting system to track emissions and carbon footprint reduction progress.
- **Long Term Sustainability:**
  - Integrate sustainability into the corporate strategy and decision-making processes.
- **Policy Advocacy:**
  - Advocate for policies and regulations supporting carbon reduction efforts and sustainability.

By implementing these strategies, Apple can work towards achieving its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030 and positively contribute to environmental conservation
